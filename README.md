# Vehicle Inventory API 🚗
```markdown

Welcome to the Vehicle Inventory API, your digital garage for managing a fleet of fabulous rides! Built with the speed and reliability of FastAPI, this service is your go-to for keeping track of every wheel in your collection.

## Features 🌟

- **ID Identification**: Every vehicle is unique, and so is their ID. We make sure each car in your inventory can be found faster than a pit stop.
- **Query Qualifiers**: Filter your fleet by make, model, or price range with the precision of a fine-tuned engine.
- **Validation Velocity**: Our API checks the validity of your vehicle details at the speed of a drag race.
- **Detail Delivery**: Get the lowdown on any car with just a click, or browse your collection with ease.
- **Test Track**: We've put our API through the paces with a variety of parameter combinations to ensure top performance.
